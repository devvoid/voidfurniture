## TODO:
- Short tables need crafting recipes and loot tables
- Book stacks need a loot table
- Make chairs and floor cushions break if the block below them is invalid.
- Better bounding boxes for book stacks and fairy lights

Needs recipe:
	- Short tables

Needs loot table:
	- Short tables
	- Bookstack
	- Candlestick

## Future ideas:
- Trunk: A little trunk, like what you'd see at the foot of a bed or something. Leather,
  with gold clasps around the edge. Smaller than a single block by a fair bit. Holds the
  same as a chest.
 
- Treasure Chest: They look like pirate chests. Otherwise the same as a regular chest.

- Teacups made of clay.

- look into sitting, see if there's a Fabric mod that will let players sit on things, and if you can
  add compatibility for it

- Roof-mounted lights
- Birdbath? See if you can make it hold water like a cauldron
