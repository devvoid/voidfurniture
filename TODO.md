## Necessary

## Probably Should
- Better bounding boxes for fairy lights

## Would Be Nice
- Fix the campfire block entity stuff so you can add the custom campfires


## Future ideas:
- Treasure Chest: They look like pirate chests. Otherwise the same as a regular chest.

- look into sitting, see if there's a Fabric mod that will let players sit on things, and if you can
  add compatibility for it

- Roof-mounted lights
- Birdbath? See if you can make it hold water like a cauldron
