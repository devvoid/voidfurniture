## Necessary

## Probably Should
- Better bounding boxes for book stacks and fairy lights

## Would Be Nice
- Fix the campfire block entity stuff so you can add the custom campfires


## Future ideas:
- Trunk: A little trunk, like what you'd see at the foot of a bed or something. Leather,
  with gold clasps around the edge. Smaller than a single block by a fair bit. Holds the
  same as a chest.

- Quill: Only struggle would be the feather texture... can I use vanilla's? if not, ask vern or nerd
 
- Treasure Chest: They look like pirate chests. Otherwise the same as a regular chest.

- Teacups made of clay.

- look into sitting, see if there's a Fabric mod that will let players sit on things, and if you can
  add compatibility for it

- Roof-mounted lights
- Birdbath? See if you can make it hold water like a cauldron
