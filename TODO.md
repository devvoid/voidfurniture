## TODO
- Campfires need recipes to turn them back into their vanilla counterparts
- A README.md would be appreciated
- Better collision shape for fairy lights


## Future ideas:
- Structures making use of some of the new blocks.
- look into sitting, see if there's a Fabric mod that will let players sit on things, and if you can add compatibility for it
- Roof-mounted lights
- Birdbaths, maybe?
